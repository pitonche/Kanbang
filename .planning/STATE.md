# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-15)

**Core value:** Add a task in seconds, find any past task by keyword in seconds -- the board stays clean because Done items auto-archive, but history is never lost.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (Foundation)
Plan: 1 of 2 in current phase

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-foundation | 1 | 4min | 4min |

**Recent Trend:**

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 6 phases derived from 18 v1 requirements -- Foundation, Task Management, Drag and Drop, Search and Filters, Auto-Archive, Polish and Deploy
- [Roadmap]: Drag-and-drop isolated into own phase (Phase 3) due to highest technical risk (snap-back, Convex reactive query integration)
- [Roadmap]: Search (Phase 4) depends only on Phase 1 schema, not on drag-and-drop -- can potentially be built in parallel
- [01-01]: bun 1.3.9 creates text-based bun.lock (not binary bun.lockb) -- lockfile name differs from older bun versions
- [01-01]: Removed template demo code (myFunctions.ts, App.tsx demo content) after schema replacement broke build references

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 3]: Drag-and-drop snap-back with Convex reactive queries is the highest-risk integration point -- may need research-phase before planning
