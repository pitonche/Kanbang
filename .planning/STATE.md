# Project State

## Project Reference

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 6 phases derived from 18 v1 requirements -- Foundation, Task Management, Drag and Drop, Search and Filters, Auto-Archive, Polish and Deploy
- [Roadmap]: Drag-and-drop isolated into own phase (Phase 3) due to highest technical risk (snap-back, Convex reactive query integration)
- [Roadmap]: Search (Phase 4) depends only on Phase 1 schema, not on drag-and-drop -- can potentially be built in parallel

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 3]: Drag-and-drop snap-back with Convex reactive queries is the highest-risk integration point -- may need research-phase before planning
